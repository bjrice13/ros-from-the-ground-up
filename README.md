Welcome to my repository of ROS (ROS1) and ROS2 tutorials, *ROS from the Ground Up*.

This repository contains several different branches, each containing tutorials and
code specific to a single ROS or ROS2 distribution.

<br>

### **If you are seeing this README file, please switch your active Git branch, selecting a specific ROS distribution.**

<details>
<summary>How to switch branches?</summary>

### GitHub (Browser)
1. Click on the button that says `start` just above this section.
2. In the drop-down list that appeared, click on the branch you'd like to switch
   to.

*For more guidance, see: https://www.howtogeek.com/789268/how-to-switch-branches-in-github/*

<br>

### Git (Terminal)
1. Get list of all branches.
```bash
git branch -r
```
2. Pick a branch, say `origin/noetic`. To switch to this branch, type the
following command (excluding the `origin/` prefix like shown):
```bash
git checkout noetic
```

These tutorials were developed in conjunction with my YouTube series, [*ROS from
the Ground Up.*](https://www.youtube.com/RetroEngineerVideos) All *ROS from the
Ground Up* videos will be posted to my channel, [Retro
Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/RetroEngineerVideos). 

All tutorials will be based in ROS Python (i.e. rospy) unless otherwise
specified.
